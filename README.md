## Introduction

Layered Crate aims to simplify the management of internal dependencies in Rust projects. By using this tool, you can organize your code into modules while ensuring that each module interacts smoothly with others. This helps in maintaining clean code architecture and promotes code reuse.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Break down your application into smaller, manageable modules.
- **Compile-Time Checks**: Catch dependency issues early with compile-time checks.
- **Procedural Macros**: Utilize Rust's powerful macro system to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality with built-in tools for code analysis.
- **Flexible Structure**: Adapt the crate structure to fit your project's needs.

## Installation

To install Layered Crate, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
layered-crate = "1.0.0"
```

Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cargo build
```

## Usage

Using Layered Crate is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

1. **Define Modules**: Create your modules within the `src` directory.
2. **Manage Dependencies**: Use Layered Crate to define and manage dependencies between these modules.

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```rust
mod module_a {
    pub fn greet() {
        println!("Hello from Module A!");
    }
}

mod module_b {
    use crate::module_a;

    pub fn greet() {
        module_a::greet();
        println!("Hello from Module B!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    module_b::greet();
}
```

In this example, `Module B` depends on `Module A`. Layered Crate helps you manage such dependencies easily.
